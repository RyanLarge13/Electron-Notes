# Commit Message Guidelines

A well-crafted commit message helps in understanding the purpose and context of changes. Follow the guidelines below when writing commit messages:

## Commit Message Format

Each commit message should have the following format:

Descriptive Title

Type: <type>

Detailed description of the commit.

### Example

```
Add user authentication feature

Type: feature

Implemented user authentication using JWT for enhanced security.
```

## Commit Message Types

Use one of the following types in your commit message:

- `feature`: Introduce a new feature to the project.
- `bugfix`: Fix a bug in the codebase.
- `refactor`: Restructure existing code without changing its external behavior.
- `doc`: Update or add documentation.
- `style`: Make stylistic or formatting changes (whitespace, formatting, etc.).
- `test`: Add or modify tests.
- `chore`: Routine tasks, maintenance, or tooling changes.

## Guidelines

- Keep the title concise (around 50 characters).
- Use the imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Adding feature").
- Separate the title and type with a blank line.
- Provide a detailed description of the changes in the body.
- Reference any relevant issues or pull requests.

### Example

```
Add user authentication feature

Type: feature

Implemented user authentication using JWT for enhanced security.

Closes #123
```

Remember to follow these guidelines for clear and informative commit messages. This makes it easier for collaborators to understand the purpose of each commit.
